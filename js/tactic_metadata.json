Common approaches are  to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities. Examples of elevated access include: <br>* SYSTEM/root level<br>* local administrator<br>user account with admin-like access <br>* user accounts with access to  specific system or perform specific function<br>* These techniques often overlap with Persistence techniques, as OS features  that let an adversary persist can execute in an elevated context.",
